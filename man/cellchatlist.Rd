\title{Example CellChat objects dataset with multiple conditions}
\format{
A named list with 3 CellChat objects:
\describe{
  \item{WT}{CellChat object representing the Wild Type condition (reference)}
  \item{KO}{CellChat object representing the Knockout condition}
  \item{DKO}{CellChat object representing the Double Knockout condition}
}
}
\source{
Single-cell RNA sequencing data from a mouse model comparing wild-type,
  knockout, and double knockout conditions.
}
\usage{
cellchatlist
}
\description{
A list containing three example CellChat objects representing different genetic conditions.
These objects have been preprocessed and contain the necessary slots for cell-cell
communication analysis using CellDiff package functions, particularly for multi-condition comparison.
}
\details{
Each CellChat object contains various slots including:
\itemize{
  \item{idents}{Cell type identities}
  \item{net}{Communication network information}
  \item{netP}{Pathway-level communication network information}
  \item{LR}{Ligand-receptor pair information}
  \item{DB}{Database of interactions}
}

These CellChat objects have been processed with the standard CellChat workflow:
1. Created from single-cell expression data
2. Identification of overexpressed ligands/receptors
3. Inference of cell-cell communication network
4. Computation of network centrality scores
5. Aggregation of network at the pathway level

The WT condition serves as the reference for multi-condition comparisons.
}
\note{
The dataset contains synthetic data generated for demonstration purposes.

\title{Calculate sender and receiver scores for cell types using centrality metrics}
\usage{
calculateScores(
  obj,
  cell_types,
  pathways,
  filter_vals = FALSE,
  slot.name = "netP"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A CellChat object containing centrality metrics}

\item{cell_types}{Character vector of cell type names to analyze}

\item{pathways}{Character vector of pathway names to analyze}

\item{filter_vals}{Logical, whether to filter values based on significance (deprecated, kept for compatibility)}

\item{slot.name}{Character, name of the slot to extract data from (default: "netP")}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
  \itemize{
    \item sender: Named numeric vector of sender scores for each cell type
    \item receiver: Named numeric vector of receiver scores for each cell type
  }
}
\description{
This function calculates both sender and receiver signaling scores for specified
cell types and pathways based on the centrality metrics in a CellChat object.
}
\examples{
# Calculate sender and receiver scores for all cell types in all pathways
scores <- calculateScores(cellchat_obj,
                         cell_types = levels(cellchat_obj@idents),
                         pathways = cellchat_obj@netP$pathways)

}

\title{Calculate signaling scores for cell types using centrality metrics}
\usage{
calculateSignaling(
  obj,
  cell_types,
  pathways,
  measure = c("sender", "receiver", "both", "influence"),
  slot.name = "netP"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A CellChat object containing centrality metrics}

\item{cell_types}{Character vector of cell type names to analyze}

\item{pathways}{Character vector of pathway names to analyze}

\item{measure}{Character, specifies the signaling role to analyze: "sender" (outgoing signaling),
"receiver" (incoming signaling), "both" (overall signaling), or "influence" (product of sender and receiver)}

\item{slot.name}{Character, name of the slot to extract data from (default: "netP")}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of signaling scores for the specified cell types
}
\description{
This function calculates signaling scores for specified cell types and pathways
based on the centrality metrics in a CellChat object.
}
\examples{
# Calculate sender scores for all cell types in the first pathway
sender_scores <- calculateSignaling(cellchat_obj,
                                   cell_types = levels(cellchat_obj@idents),
                                   pathways = cellchat_obj@netP$pathways[1],
                                   measure = "sender")

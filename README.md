# CellDiff
Enhances visualization and statistical analysis of cell-cell communication differences between experimental groups.

CellDiff is an R package that enhances visualization and statistical analysis of cell-cell communication differences between experimental groups. Building upon CellChat and other cell-cell communication results, CellDiff provides specialized functions for comparative analysis and visualization of differential cell-cell communication patterns.
Features
CellDiff focuses on three main areas:

Improved Visualization: Enhanced visualizations that directly highlight differences between conditions
Statistical Testing: Robust statistical methods to identify significant changes in cell-cell communication
Comprehensive Analysis: Multiple perspectives on communication differences (pathway, cell type, direction)
